### Rules abstract class
1. Only instance methods can be marked `abstract` within a class, not variables,
constructors, or `static` methods.
2. A non-abstract class that extends an abstract class must implement all
inherited abstract methods.
3. Overriding an abstract method follows the existing rules for overriding methods that
you learned about earlier in the chapter.
